# User-generated reviews are often our first point of contact when we consider watching a movie or a TV show. However, beyond telling us the qualitative aspects of the item we want to consume, reviews may inevitably contain undesired information (i.e. 'spoilers').  Therefore, a general question is how to identify these spoilers in entertainment reviews, so that users can more effectively navigate review platforms.
